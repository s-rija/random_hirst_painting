# random_hirst_painting

Hirst Painting in Python This is a simple implementation of a Hirst Painting using Python and the Turtle module.

Getting Started Prerequisites To run the program, you'll need Python 3 and the Turtle module installed on your system.

How to Use The program generates a Hirst Painting by creating a grid of circles of random colors. You can adjust the size of the circles, the spacing between them, and the number of rows and columns in the grid by editing the values in the hirst_painting.py file.

The program uses the Turtle module to draw the circles, so you can see the painting being generated in real time. Once the painting is complete, you can save it as an image by pressing the s key.
